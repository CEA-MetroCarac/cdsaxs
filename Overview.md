# Overview


Miniaturizing transistors, the building blocks of integrated circuits, presents significant challenges for the semiconductor industry. Precisely measuring these features during production is crucial for high-quality chips. Existing in-line metrology techniques, such as optical critical-dimension (OCD) scatterometry and critical-dimension scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM), are nearing their limits. OCD struggles with the inherent limitations of light and shrinking features, while CD-SEM, despite providing valuable insights, is restricted by sampling area and resolution. To overcome these obstacles, the industry is exploring X-ray-based metrology. X-rays, with their shorter wavelengths, allow for more precise analysis and are sensitive to variations in composition, providing richer data.


CD-SAXS (Critical Dimension Small Angle X-ray Scattering) is a promising technique for nanostructure electronics. It uses a transmission geometry, sending the beam through the sample and the 750 micrometer-thick silicon wafer. The x-ray spot size varies between 10-1000 Î¼m, enabling the measurement of small patterned areas. Studies have shown CD-SAXS's effectiveness in characterizing the shape and spacing of nanometer-sized patterns.

Although several big companies are developing software for CD-SAXS, this technique is still in its infancy and there isn't an open source coherent package available for its data analysis. Thus, this `cdsaxs` package is aimed at providing simulation and fitting tools for CD-SAXS synchotron data for researchers.

# Simulation models

For the moment we have two kinds of most commonly used samples in the industry. The first one is a cross section of a line in a line/space pattern. Here the cross section of line is modeled by a stack of trapezoids that together form the shape of the cross section as shown in figure below. Thus it is named Stacked trapezoid model.

The second model is similar in concept but with another nano-structure on top of it as shown in figure below. It is called the Strong Castle Model. It is very useful to model the overlay of two structures.

To obtain the Intensity map of the scattering pattern, we do the fourier transformation of each individual trapezoid and then sum them up. The fourier transformation of a trapezoid is given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    F\left(q_{x}, q_{z}\right) = \frac{1}{q_{x}}\left[
    -\frac{m_{1}}{t_{1}} e^{-i q_{x}\left(\frac{\omega_{0}}{2}\right)}\left(1 - e^{-i h\left(\frac{q_{x}}{m_{1}} + q_{z}\right)}\right)
    + \frac{m_{2}}{t_{2}} e^{-i q_{x}\left(\frac{\omega_{0}}{2}\right)}\left(1 - e^{-i h\left(\frac{q_{x}}{m_{2}} + q_{z}\right)}\right)
    \right]
    \label{eq:trapezoidal_ft}
\end{equation}

where,

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{m}_{1} = \tan\left(\beta_{1}\right) \\
m_{2} = \tan\left(\pi - \beta_{r}\right) \\
t_{1} = q_{x} + m_{1} q_{z} \\
t_{2} = q_{x} + m_{2} q_{z}
\end{array}
\]
